# Arithmetic Calculator REST API

This is a Node.js based backend REST API for a simple arithmetic calculator functionality. The API supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and a random string generation.

Each functionality has a separate cost per request, and users have a starting credit/balance. Each request will be deducted from the user's balance, and if the user's balance is not enough to cover the request cost, the request will be denied.

- Node.js
